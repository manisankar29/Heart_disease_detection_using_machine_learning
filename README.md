## Introduction

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally. World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. Thus preventing heart diseases has become more than necessary. The implementation of data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases is crucial to advancing research and prevention efforts, ultimately promoting healthier lives for a larger population. 
 
  In this context, the application of machine learning emerges as a crucial tool. Machine learning plays a vital role in accurately predicting heart diseases.
